I recently migrated this website from Wordpress to Github pages using Jekyll and poole. So far I am really happy with the transition. Over time, I grew to really dislike how heavy-weight Wordpress is. I dislike how WYSIWYG editors make it really hard to see what HTML is being generated and tend to bloat the code that is produced. I found the Wordpress plugin system so confusing that I was afraid to try to customize the layout of anything.
