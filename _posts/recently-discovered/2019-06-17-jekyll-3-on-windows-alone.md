Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, is very easy to set up on Mac OS X or Linux. On Windows, not so much. This site is here to help.

Using Jekyll on Windows is not officially supported by the Jekyll team. And while this guide is featured on the Jekyll website, it remains unofficial.

Click the big button below to get started and go through the installation process step by step or select a specific step from the sidebar on the left.
